            <h2>Special Session 8: "Natural-inspired Adaptive Optimization Algorithms: New Theory, New Local Structures, New Evolutionary Strategies, and New Applications"</h2>
            <h2>Rationale of the need for the special session at ICSI</h2>
            <p>The rationale should stress the novelty of the topic and/or its multidisciplinary flavor, and must explain how it is different from the subjects covered by the regular sessions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The need to stay current with new theoretical developments in natural-inspired optimization algorithms: As research in the field of natural-inspired optimization algorithms continues to evolve, it is important to stay current with new developments in order to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of these algorithms.</li>
                <li>The potential of new local structures, new evolutionary strategies, and other new developments to improve the performance of natural-inspired optimization algorithms: New developments in local structures and evolutionary strategies can help to improve the performance of natural-inspired optimization algorithms, making them more efficient and effective in solving complex optimization problems.</li>
                <li>The need to explore new applications of natural-inspired optimization algorithms: As new applications of natural-inspired optimization algorithms are being discovered, it is important to explore these new areas to fully understand the potential of these algorithms and how they can be applied in practice.</li>
                <li>To keep up with the cutting-edge of the field: The special session will address the recent developments and advancements in the field of natural-inspired optimization algorithms and how it can be applied in different fields, providing a valuable contribution to the swarm intelligence conference.</li>
                <li>This special session is more specific and in-depth in the sense that it is entirely focused on natural-inspired adaptive optimization algorithms and its new developments, providing an opportunity for researchers to present their most recent results and discoveries in this field. Additionally, it also aims to explore new applications of natural-inspired optimization algorithms that may not be covered in regular sessions of ICSI.</li>
                <li>The special session is also different as it is a focused platform for researchers and practitioners to share their knowledge, ideas, and experiences on the application of natural-inspired optimization algorithms in various fields, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
            <p>Potential topics for papers within the special session could include but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New theory of natural-inspired adaptive optimization algorithms</li>
                <li>New local structures of natural-inspired adaptive optimization algorithms such as niching, island models, and speciation, to improve the performance of natural-inspired optimization algorithms</li>
                <li>New evolutionary strategies of natural-inspired adaptive optimization algorithms, such as coevolution, memetic algorithms, and multi-objective optimization, and their potential to improve the performance of natural-inspired optimization algorithms</li>
                <li>New applications of natural-inspired adaptive optimization algorithms. Applying new natural inspired optimization algorithms to specific fields and applications, such as robot path planning, intelligent building energy saving measures, optimization of complex systems, et al.</li>
            </ul>
